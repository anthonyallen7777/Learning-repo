- second element comes immediately after

	color: red;
}

- second element on the same element but doesn't have to be immediately after

child

div > p {
	color: red;
}

- seconde element is a direct child of first element

descendant

div p {
	color: red;
}

- all second elements no matter if they are a direct child or not


box-sizing: content-box;
setting the width and height only applies to the content

box-sizing: border-box;
setting width and height includes padding and border (doesn't include margin)

a:not(.active) {
	color:blue;
}

classes are css specific

ids can have other non-css use (like jumping to a section of a page)
