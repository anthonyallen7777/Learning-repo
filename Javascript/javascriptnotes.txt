----

Dynamic, interpreted programming language
- Not pre-compiled, instead parsed
and compiled "On the fly" (in the browser)
- code evaluated and executed at runtime
- code can change at runtime (type of a
variable)

Weakly typed programming language
- Data types are assumed(e.g. assigned to variables)
automatically
- You don't define that same variable has to hold
a certain value(e.g. a number)
- Data types are not set in stone but can change
