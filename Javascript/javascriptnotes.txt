Javascript
- a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime
- created to make webpages more dynamic, orginally called livescript but renamed to javascript
- has nothing to do with Java

----
how is javascript executed?

your code
    |                 Parse Code
    |
Javascript Engine    Compile to Machine Code
    |
    |                Execute Machine code
    v
Effect on Webpage


Build-into the Browser
V8 (Chrome)
SpiderMonkey (Firefox)

On a Single Thread

----

Dynamic, interpreted programming language
- Not pre-compiled, instead parsed
and compiled "On the fly" (in the browser)
- code evaluated and executed at runtime
- code can change at runtime (type of a
variable)

Weakly typed programming language
- Data types are assumed(e.g. assigned to variables)
automatically
- You don't define that same variable has to hold
a certain value(e.g. a number)
- Data types are not set in stone but can change

----

Javascript runs on a host environment
Browser-side
- javascript was invented to be run
in the browser
- javascript can manipulate HTML code,
CSS, send background Http requests &
much more
- javascript can't access the local
filesystem, interact with the operating
system

"Other" (e.g. Server-side)
- Google's JavaScript Engine (V8) was
extracted to run JavaScript anywhere
(called "Node.js")
- Node.js can be executed on any machine
and is therefore often used to build web backends
(server-side Javascript)
- Node.js CAN access the local filesystem,
interact with the operating system etc. It CAN'T
manipulate HTML or CSS

Variable & Constants

variable: a "data container" / "data storage"

let userName = 'Joe';
userName = 'Mama';
