(+ 2 (* 3 4) (- (+ 1 2) 3))
b/c starts with primitive = this expression is called a "call to a primitive"

the "+" is called an operator
the "2", "(* 3 4)", "(- (+ 1 2) 3)" are called operands

To evaluate a primitive call:
- first reduce operands to values
- then apply primitive to the values

Intuitively:
- left to right
- inside to outside

predicates are primitives or functions that produce a boolean value (true or false)
