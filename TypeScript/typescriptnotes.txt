TypeScript
- really just a superset to JavaScript
- offers more features than vanillaJS (Types, Classes, Interfaces, etc.)


in TypeScript you define if a variable is a number, string, or something else
- this allows the writing of more robust code
- the code gets checked at the time you write and not just a time it is ran


TypeScript doesn't run in the browser
- gets compiled to JavaScript
